# Eight Mile
### STL fall 2022 final project by Jeff, Aly, and Emma

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We use the Strava API to gather data about a user's runs and return a playlist with their desired beats per minute to keep them on pace!

### How to get started

You will need Node.js. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
Reload the page to see changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
